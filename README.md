Implementation Plan
Backend (ASP.NET Core)
Game Mechanics

Create a GameService class to handle game logic (e.g., determining the winner, managing rounds).

Implement a BestOfThreeMatch system to track wins across multiple rounds.

Use SignalR to manage real-time communication between players.

Multiplayer & Real-Time Gameplay

Use SignalR hubs (GameHub) to facilitate real-time communication.

Implement methods for:

Starting a game session.

Joining a game session.

Submitting hand choices.

Removing a hand and resolving the round.

User Management & Authentication

Implement JWT-based authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity.

Create endpoints for:

User registration (/api/auth/register).

User login (/api/auth/login).

Fetching user match history (/api/user/history).

Database Management

Design a database schema to store:

Users (Id, Username, PasswordHash, etc.).

Matches (MatchId, Player1Id, Player2Id, WinnerId, Timestamp).

MatchHistory (MatchId, PlayerId, HandChoice, Result).

Use Entity Framework Core for database access and migrations.

Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Optimize database queries and use caching where necessary.

Security: Use HTTPS, validate inputs, and sanitize data.

Availability: Implement retry mechanisms and handle exceptions gracefully.

Observability: Use logging (e.g., Serilog) and tracing for monitoring.
